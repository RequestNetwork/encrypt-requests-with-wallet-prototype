# encrypt-requests-with-wallet-prototype

A prototype to demonstrate how to encrypt and decrypt requests with a wallet.

- Encrypt and decrypt requests
- Authenticate using a key inside a wallet (not a raw private key)
- Sessions so end user can click once to decrypt multiple requests
- Encrypt each request with a new key pair for maximum privacy
