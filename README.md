# encrypt-requests-with-wallet-prototype

A prototype to demonstrate how to encrypt and decrypt requests with a wallet.

## Objectives

- Encrypt and decrypt requests on the frontend using a private key in a wallet
- Sessions so end user can click once to decrypt multiple requests
- Encrypt each request with a new key pair for maximum privacy
